###Introduction
As you can see, it's a pretty simple 3d constructive game. In the game, you've only got two type of blocks: Constructive Block and Decorative Block, and all the blocks are the standard cube. With these blocks, you can build a world of your own.

Well, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of "Minecraft", it's a great game. Although I don't play it a lot, it did arise my inspiration. With great effort in the past two months, finally, I've made it! It's a wonderful challenge for me, and I learned a lot.

Have fun!
